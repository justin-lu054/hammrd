    "description": "Picture this, it's 4 am, you stumble out of the bar absolutely shit-faced. You need to sober up and find your way home. You try to open google maps and type in your address but there's just too much stuff, you can't manage. Now there's a solution for this, HammRD. Two buttons, no bullshit. One will direct you to the nearest open fast-food restaurant, the other to your home. We'll keep track of your location, so if you black out, your emergency contact will receive a text message with your location. Now you can get as drunk as you want and know there will always be a clear path home."
